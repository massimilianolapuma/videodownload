## Edge Cases to Test

### Network Interruption
- Test download resumption after network disconnect/reconnect
- Verify partial downloads can be resumed

### Multiple Simultaneous Downloads
- Start 3-5 downloads simultaneously
- Verify all progress correctly in side panel
- Test mixed operations (pause some, cancel others)

### Different Video Types
- HTML5 video elements
- YouTube videos (iframe detection)
- Direct video file URLs
- Streaming protocols (HLS, DASH if supported)

### Browser State Changes
- Tab switching during downloads
- Browser minimize/maximize
- Extension disable/enable
- Chrome restart (downloads should not auto-resume)

## Performance Metrics

### Memory Usage
- Monitor extension memory usage during large downloads
- Verify cleanup after download completion
- Check for memory leaks with multiple downloads

### Download Speed
- Compare download speeds with browser's native download
- Verify stream recording doesn't introduce significant overhead
- Test on various network conditions

### UI Responsiveness
- Popup should remain responsive during downloads
- Side panel updates should not cause UI freezing
- Progress updates should be smooth (not jumpy)

## Debugging Tools

### Console Logging
- Background script logs download events
- Content script logs video detection and recording
- Side panel logs UI interactions

### Chrome DevTools
- Use Application → Service Workers to monitor background script
- Check Network tab for video URL detection
- Monitor Downloads in Chrome's download manager

### Extension Inspection
- Right-click extension icon → "Inspect popup"
- Right-click extension icon → "Inspect service worker"
- Check console for error messages

## Success Criteria

### Issue #1 (Incomplete Downloads) - FIXED ✅

## 🧪 Testing the Fixes

### **Test 1: Connection Test**

```bash
1. Open: tests/comprehensive-connection-test.html
2. Click "Run Full Test Suite"
3. Should see all green checkmarks:
   ✅ Connection Test
   ✅ Video Detection Test
   ✅ Storage Test
```

### **Test 2: Real World Video Detection**

```bash
1. Visit any website with videos (YouTube, news sites, etc.)
2. Click the extension icon to open sidepanel
3. Should see detected videos listed
4. Check console for debug logs (F12)
```

### **Test 3: Debug Panel**

```bash
1. Open sidepanel on any page
2. Click "Debug Info" button
3. Should see:
   - Current tab info
   - Content script status
   - Storage contents
   - Connection test results
```

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Critical Issues Resolved:**

1. **"Could not establish connection"** → Retry logic with exponential backoff
2. **Videos not detected** → Enhanced detection with 25+ URL patterns
3. **Sidepanel communication errors** → Fixed method calls and error handling
4. **Project disorganization** → Moved files to proper directories

### **Performance Improvements:**

- Automatic content script injection via manifest
- Multiple video scan attempts (0.5s, 1.5s, 3s, 5s intervals)
- Better error messages for users
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## 📊 Expected Results

### **Working Correctly:**

```
✅ Extension loads without errors
✅ Sidepanel opens when clicking extension icon
✅ Videos are detected on pages with video content
✅ No "connection" errors in console
✅ Storage shows detected videos
✅ Debug panel provides useful information
```

### **Console Output (Normal):**

```
🚀 Video Downloader content script loading...
✅ Content script responded to ping
📊 Video scan response: {videos: Array(X)}
💾 Stored X videos for tab XXXXX
```

### **Console Output (Troubleshooting):**

```
❌ Attempt 1 failed: Could not establish connection
⏳ Waiting 500ms before retry...
✅ Content script responded to ping (attempt 2)
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **If Extension Won't Load:**

1. Check for syntax errors: `npm run validate`
2. Reload extension in chrome://extensions/
3. Check Chrome console for error messages

### **If Videos Not Detected:**

1. Open sidepanel debug panel
2. Check if content script is responding
3. Try clicking "Rescan" button
4. Check console logs for detection attempts

### **If Connection Still Fails:**

1. Refresh the webpage
2. Wait 5 seconds for retry attempts
3. Check Chrome permissions are granted
4. Try on different websites

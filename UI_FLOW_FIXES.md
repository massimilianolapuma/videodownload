# UI Flow Fixes - Video Downloader Extension

## Problem Fixed

**Issue**: Clicking the extension icon was opening the side panel instead of the main popup interface for video scanning and downloading.

## Root Cause

The `manifest.json` had both `action.default_popup` and `side_panel` configurations, and the background script was forcing the side panel to open on action click with:
```javascript
chrome.sidePanel.setPanelBehavior({ openPanelOnActionClick: true });
```

This overrode the default popup behavior.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Restored Default Popup Behavior
- **Manifest Configuration**: Kept both `action.default_popup` and `side_panel` configurations
- **Background Script**: Removed forced side panel opening on action click
- **Result**: Extension icon click now opens the popup interface by default

### 2. Programmatic Side Panel Opening
- **On Download Start**: Side panel automatically opens when downloads begin for progress tracking
- **Manual Access**: Added "ðŸ“Š Download Manager" button in popup for manual access
- **Background Method**: Added `openSidePanel()` method for programmatic control

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Primary Interface**: Popup remains the main interface for video scanning and downloading
- **Secondary Interface**: Side panel serves as dedicated download management interface
- **Seamless Integration**: Downloads automatically trigger side panel for progress monitoring

## Current UI Flow

### Normal Workflow:
1. **Click Extension Icon** â†’ Opens popup interface
2. **Click "Scan for Videos"** â†’ Detects videos on current page
3. **Click "Download"** â†’ Starts download and automatically opens side panel
4. **Monitor Progress** â†’ Track downloads in side panel

### Manual Access:
1. **Click Extension Icon** â†’ Opens popup interface
2. **Click "Download Manager"** â†’ Manually opens side panel
3. **View Downloads** â†’ See active and completed downloads
